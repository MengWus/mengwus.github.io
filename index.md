<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geospatial Engineering](https://www.mtu.edu/cege/) at [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/). 

My research lies at the intersection of materials science and computational simulation â€” with a special focus on **multi-scale aging and adhesive behavior of asphalt systems**. My research interests include **molecular dynamics simulation**, **high-throughput property prediction**, **rubber-modified asphalt**, recycled pavement materials, pavement aging, and **sustainable asphalt technologies**.

Previously, I completed my Master's in Road and Railway Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) and my BS in Road, Bridge, and River-Crossing Engineering at [Chang'an University](https://en.chd.edu.cn/5753/list.htm). I also spent time at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1).
